Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. 
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. All thanks to http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/ :) If you guys like my set up, head over to the author's site!
